 ### Project Description
- This project aims to create a fine-tuned language model specialized in the KTU (Kerala Technological University) syllabus. The goal is to develop a resource that can answer questions, summarize content, and provide insights based on the KTU curriculum, making study and revision easier for students. By fine-tuning a language model on KTU-specific content such as textbooks, syllabus documents, and past question papers, we can create a powerful tool for academic assistance.

## Academic Resource Collection

## The Solution

Using a specialized language model, this tool enables easy study and revision of KTU topics, offering summaries, explanations, and question-answering functionalities tailored to the KTU curriculum.
