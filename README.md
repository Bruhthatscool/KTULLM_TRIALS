The goal is to develop a resource that can answer questions, summarize content, and provide insights based on the KTU curriculum, making study and revision easier for students. By fine-tuning a language model on KTU-specific content such as textbooks, syllabus documents, and past question papers, we can create a powerful tool for academic assistance.]
